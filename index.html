  The Island of Samos was the birthplace of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a>, the founder of a mystic cult, at the nexus of trade between the Greek Agean and the Near East, in which the logical simplicity of mathematical proof was taken as a basis for making sense of the universe as a whole. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory">Type theory</a>, in its modern form, is the engine beneath modern-day A.I. systems which are rapidly approaching, and even exceeding, humans in their ability to establish mathematical truths.
